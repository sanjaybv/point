# point

Collaborative drawing and chatting tool written in Golang.
Developed this tool in my spare time to get familiarized with golang, websockets, socket programming, web app development. This was done in Fall 2014 during my time in Zoho.

Server is written entierly in Go. It includes an HTTP service, chat service and drawing service, where each runs on a different port.
HTML and javascript is used in the clientside.
CSS framework used here is Semantic UI.

## Installation

1. Install golang. ([https://golang.org/doc/install])
2. In a terminal, run the command `go get github.com/sanjaybv/point`.
3. Once installed, you should be able to run the server by running the command `point`.

**Don't forget to tell your friends your ip address and ask them to join you for a game of pictionary :P**
