# point

Collaborative drawing and messaging web-app written in Golang.
Developed this app in my spare time to get familiarized with golang, websockets, socket programming, web app development. This was done in Fall 2014 during my time in Zoho.

**Head over to [http://sbv-point.herokuapp.com](http://sbv-point.herokuapp.com) to see the app live.**

HTML, JavaScript and HTML Canvas is used in the clientside for drawing and communication.
